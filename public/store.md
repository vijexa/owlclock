# OwlClockðŸ¦‰

This is a simple clock implementation that helps you track your in-game time and sync it with other players in the same room. For example, you can track travel time, crafting time, rest, etc. 

## Functions

You can edit the time directly by editing it in the text field, or by using the "Add" field and "Hours"/"Minutes" buttons. The time will be saved in room data. Only GM can edit the time. You can switch between 24-hour and 12-hour time format in the settings. You can save frequently-used time changes as presets by clicking heart icon.

### "Calendar!" extension integration

If you have "Calendar!" extension from "Battle-System" installed, you can enable integration with it in the settings. When time reaches midnight, it will automatically increment the day in the calendar.
